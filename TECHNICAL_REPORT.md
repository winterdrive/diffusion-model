# Technical Report: Conditional Diffusion Model for i-CLEVR Generation

## Overview

This technical report presents the implementation and evaluation of a Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) for multi-label image synthesis using the i-CLEVR dataset. The objective is to generate synthetic images containing specific objects based on a given set of multi-label conditions. The implementation features a UNet architecture as the denoising network, incorporating conditional information via label embeddings.

The experiments focus on investigating the impact of image preprocessing methods and the inclusion of self-attention mechanisms within the UNet backbone on generation quality and classification accuracy. Several memory optimization techniques were implemented to enable feasible training on limited GPU resources. The synthesized images were evaluated using a pre-trained ResNet18 classifier.

## 1. Implementation Details

### 1.1 Project Architecture

The project is organized with the following key components:

- **`src/main.py`**: Main execution script for training, sampling, and inference
- **`src/models/ddpm.py`**: Implementation of the DDPM process
- **`src/models/unet.py`**: Core UNet model definition
- **`src/training/dataset.py`**: Data loading and preprocessing utilities
- **`src/training/trainer.py`**: Training and evaluation utilities
- **`src/evaluator.py`**: Pre-trained ResNet18 evaluator
- **`src/preprocess_images.py`**: Image preprocessing utilities

### 1.2 Data Processing and Preprocessing Optimization

The i-CLEVR dataset is loaded using a custom dataset class with multi-label annotations converted into one-hot vectors used as conditional inputs. Original image resolution is 320×240. To determine the optimal image processing method for compatibility with the pre-trained 64×64 evaluator, five different preprocessing strategies were systematically evaluated using 10,000 images:

#### Preprocessing Methods Evaluation

1. **Direct resize (97.22% accuracy)**: Directly resize the image to the target size (64×64) without maintaining the aspect ratio
2. **Resize then crop (40.52% accuracy)**: Resize while maintaining the aspect ratio, then center crop to the target size
3. **Crop then resize (67.18% accuracy)**: Center crop the image to match the aspect ratio of the target, then resize
4. **Aspect resize crop (67.75% accuracy)**: Resize respecting the aspect ratio to fit the shortest dimension, then crop
5. **Pad resize (79.47% accuracy)**: Pad the image to a square with black borders, then resize

The **Direct resize** method achieved 97.22% accuracy, substantially outperforming other methods. This indicates that the pre-trained evaluator model was likely trained on directly resized images, and this approach effectively preserves object relative positions and sizes.

### 1.3 Conditional DDPM and UNet Architecture

The core of the conditional DDPM is the UNet-based denoising network with the following components:

#### Network Architecture

- **Downsampling and upsampling paths** with skip connections
- **Residual Blocks (ResBlocks)** for feature extraction
- **Time embedding**: Sinusoidal position embeddings for diffusion timesteps
- **Label embedding**: Multi-hot label vectors transformed via small MLP
- **Self-attention layers**: Optional attention at specific resolutions (8×8 and 16×16)

#### Training Configuration

- **Noise Schedule**: Cosine schedule for smoother noise progression
- **Loss Function**: L2 (MSE) loss for noise prediction
- **Conditional Guidance**: Label embeddings injected into ResBlocks

### 1.4 Diffusion Process and Sampling

The DDPM implements both forward (noise addition) and reverse (denoising) processes:

#### Forward Process

- Gradual noise addition according to predetermined schedule
- Precomputed noise schedule for efficiency

#### Reverse Process

- Iterative denoising from pure noise
- Guided by time and label embeddings
- **Classifier Guidance**: Leverages gradient information from pre-trained evaluator during sampling
- Guidance scale set to 4.0 for optimal performance

### 1.5 Memory Optimization Techniques

To address GPU memory constraints, the following optimizations were implemented:

- **Gradient Accumulation**: Larger effective batch sizes through gradient accumulation
- **Reduced Evaluation Batch Size**: Batch size of 1 during evaluation
- **Periodic Cache Clearing**: `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` to reduce memory fragmentation
- **Memory-Efficient Attention**: Optimized attention computation

## 2. Experimental Setup and Model Configurations

### 3.2 Key Experimental Findings

#### Preprocessing Impact

The model utilizing direct resize preprocessing achieved the highest accuracy on both test sets. The direct resize method preserved object positioning and scale information crucial for the evaluator's classification accuracy.

#### Self-Attention Benefits

Models incorporating self-attention layers consistently outperformed the base model without attention. Self-attention helped capture long-range spatial relationships and object interactions, crucial for generating complex multi-object scenes.

#### Classifier Guidance Effectiveness

Classifier guidance effectively steered the generative process towards images deemed correct by the evaluator, providing significant performance improvements.

#### Training Dynamics

The lowest training loss did not necessarily correlate with the highest evaluation accuracy, suggesting potential overfitting or discrepancy between the training objective (noise prediction) and evaluation metric (object classification).

### 3.3 Generation Quality Analysis

#### Denoising Process Visualization

The denoising process shows progressive construction of coherent objects from noise:

1. General shapes emerge early in the process
2. Finer details develop in middle stages
3. Colors and spatial relationships refine in final stages

The model successfully generates images containing multiple objects with correct attributes (shape, color) and reasonable spatial arrangements.
